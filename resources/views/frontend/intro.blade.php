                        I've been painting for 16 years But in Resin art its about 4 years. While being an artist is a
                        difficult tug-of-war between my inner dreamer and critic, I've grown to love this process a lot.
                        It
                        hasn't just taught me much about the world, but also about myself,
                        If I describe what value Art possesses for me, its my passion my life. And thinking creative is
                        my
                        Food.
                        I simple Love to do challenging Art Work

                        The name “Art Wings by SM” majorly deals in Resin Products, but I tend to work on different
                        other
                        mediums as well such as, Textured Paste - Acrylic Painting - Alcohol Ink Art - Mineral Art -
                        Jesmonite - and Wax Candle etc.
